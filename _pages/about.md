Hi, welcome! My name is Junlong Xu, and I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Finance at Aalto University School of Business. My research interests lie in empirical asset pricing and international finance, with a particular focus on global capital flow risk.

Prior to joining Aalto, I earned an M.Sc. in Finance at the Stockholm School of Economics and a dual B.Sc. in Financial Mathematics from the University of Liverpool and Xiâ€™an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. My academic background combines quantitative skills with applied financial research, which continues to shape my current work.
